        <p>Thanks for purchasing our products at My Java Learning Center operated by
            Srinivas Dandey.</p>
        <p>
            We offer a full money-back guarantee for all purchases made on our website. If you are not
            satisfied with the product that you have purchased from us, you can get your money back no
            questions asked. You are eligible for a full reimbursement within 14 calendar days of your
            purchase.

        <p>
            After the 14-day period you will no longer be eligible and won't be able to receive a refund. We
            encourage our customers to try the product (or service) in the first two weeks after their
            purchase to ensure it fits your needs.
